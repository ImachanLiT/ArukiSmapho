This is an obj and 3ds version of the .gsm previously posted at http://artist-3d.com/free_3d_models/dnm/model_disp.php?uid=537.

Not many apps can open a .gsm file so I'm lucky I found a 3ds version (along with another .gsm) at another site. I made modifications to the 3ds version in Wings 3D. Mostly I separated the girl, her glasses, the dog and his lease/collar into separate sub-objects. Also I re-arranged the UVs so they are not overlapping. The UV mapping still needs work but since the materials define the color fine this is not need too much unless the end user want to do more. From Wings I export as .3ds and .obj formats. The render was done in Cinema 4D.

Hope you enjoy.
